## Problem to Solve

Toward the beginning of World 1-1 in Nintendo’s Super Mario Brothers, Mario must hop over adjacent pyramids of blocks, per the below.

In a file called `mario.c` in a folder called `mario-more`, implement a program in C that recreates that pyramid, using hashes (`#`) for bricks, as in the below:

```
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
```

And let’s allow the user to decide just how tall the pyramids should be by first prompting them for a positive `int` between, say, 1 and 8, inclusive.

Examples

Here’s how the program might work if the user inputs `8` when prompted:

```
$ ./mario
Height: 8
       #  #
      ##  ##
     ###  ###
    ####  ####
   #####  #####
  ######  ######
 #######  #######
########  ########

```

Here’s how the program might work if the user inputs `4` when prompted:

```
$ ./mario
Height: 4
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
```

Here’s how the program might work if the user inputs `2` when prompted:

```
$ ./mario
Height: 2
 #  #
##  ##
```

And here’s how the program might work if the user inputs `1` when prompted:

```
$ ./mario
Height: 1
#  #
```

If the user doesn’t, in fact, input a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive, when prompted, the program should re-prompt the user until they cooperate:

```
$ ./mario
Height: -1
Height: 0
Height: 42
Height: 50
Height: 4
   #  #
  ##  ##
 ###  ###
####  ####
```

Notice that width of the “gap” between adjacent pyramids is equal to the width of two hashes, irrespective of the pyramids’ heights.

### How to Test Your Code

Does your code work as prescribed when you input

- `-1` (or other negative numbers)?
- `0`?
- `1` through `8`?
- `9` or other positive numbers?
- letters or words?
- no input at all, when you only hit Enter?
